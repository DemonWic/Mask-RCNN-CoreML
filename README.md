# Mask-RCNN-CoreML
Mask-RCNN for Core ML (WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Features

- [] CoreML inference of https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN pretrained weights
- [] Mobile-optimized backbone
- [] Support for pose estimation

## Goals

Why would you use Mask-RCNN on mobile? The uses cases I see are not real-time (yet). Basically, you would use it in places where accuracy is important, but real-time is not necessarily.
